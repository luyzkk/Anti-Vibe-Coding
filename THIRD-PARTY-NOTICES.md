# Third-Party Notices

This file lists third-party works that the Anti-Vibe-Coding plugin includes content **derived from** (not copied verbatim). Each entry preserves the upstream copyright notice and license text as required by the upstream license terms.

## Anti-Vibe-Coding plugin includes content derived from third-party works:

### agent-skills (Addy Osmani, MIT License)

The atoms in `knowledge/nextjs/atoms/*.md` are **distilled** from the `agent-skills` repository by Addy Osmani (MIT licensed). Distillation involves selecting senior patterns, anti-patterns, and decision criteria from upstream SKILL.md V2 files and rewriting them in the Anti-Vibe-Coding atom format (frontmatter + 4 mandatory sections). Each derivative atom lists the upstream SKILL.md V2 path in its frontmatter `sources:` field for audit traceability.

**Upstream license verified locally at:** `Infos/knowledge/NextJS/agent-skills-main/LICENSE` (the `Infos/` directory is `.gitignore`-d as reference material — the LICENSE file lives outside the public repo but its text is reproduced verbatim below per the MIT preservation clause).

**Upstream SKILL.md V2 files used as inspiration for `knowledge/nextjs/atoms/`:**

1. `nextjs-app-router-patterns V1` (`Infos/knowledge/NextJS/agent-skills-main/nextjs-app-router-patterns/SKILL.md`)
2. `nextjs-app-router-patterns V2` (`Infos/knowledge/NextJS/agent-skills-main/nextjs-app-router-patterns V2/SKILL.md`)
3. `nextjs-best-practices` (`Infos/knowledge/NextJS/agent-skills-main/nextjs-best-practices/SKILL.md`)
4. `nextjs-expert` (`Infos/knowledge/NextJS/agent-skills-main/nextjs-expert/SKILL.md`)
5. `nextjs-supabase-auth` (`Infos/knowledge/NextJS/agent-skills-main/nextjs-supabase-auth/SKILL.md`)
6. `nextjs-turbopack` (`Infos/knowledge/NextJS/agent-skills-main/nextjs-turbopack/SKILL.md`)

## Future expansion

If future stacks (Phoenix? Go? Elixir?) include derivative content from third-party works, append additional sections (`### <upstream-name> (<author>, <license>)`) to this file. Keep this single file as the canonical NOTICES — do not split across matrix folders.
